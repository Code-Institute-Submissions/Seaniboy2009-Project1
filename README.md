## Testing

I have tested my site for 3 resolution, 2000px, 1200px and 720px, these resolutions are part of the responsiveness i have added to the CSS.

I have run the code though a html and css validation as well as lighthouse to make sure it is accessible for the impaired.

    - Had a lot of bugs with the margin and container when scaling up and down, it to experiment a lot with with % and margins to get it working and looking good.
    
    - gitpod images for this document are not working on github
