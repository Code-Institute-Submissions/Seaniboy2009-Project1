## Deployment

I have used GitHub and Gitpod to create and version control my project, I have also then used GitHub pages to deploy my project to a live environment [Live version](https://seaniboy2009.github.io/Project1/).

## Testing

I have tested my site for 3 resolution, 2000px, 1200px and 720px, these resolutions are part of the responsiveness i have added to the CSS.

I have run the code though a html and css validation as well as lighthouse to make sure it is accessible for the impaired.

- HTML
  - Tested html code though [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea)
- CSS
  - Tested css code though [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator)

- Spellchecking
    - [Online Spellchecker](https://www.online-spellcheck.com/)

- Lighthouse accessablitly, the accessablity is not 100% because there is no text for the social icons, But there is not suposed to be otherwise this score would be 100%
